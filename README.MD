**Author:** Armand (Tydax) BOUR

## Description
This is a repository for the pages that I developped for the [chocolicornes.org](http://www.chocolicornes.org/) website.
*chocolicornes.org* is a website that we are building with my friends from the Lille 1 university (we are students in computer science) to host our personal content, like projects that we built. The main idea is to host our personal content that we can show off the world.

## To-do
Idea list for the homepage:
* Have a decent design;
* Generate the page dynamically with a .json;
* Add sexy animations;
* Generate each profile using a .json contained in each page.

Known bugs:
* Put border-radius
